## Name Ideas
- SportsHub
- GameSetMatch

## Main Premise
We will have a main menu/site that directs people to multiple sports-themed mini games. We will degrade the sports to their most basic functions. For tennis we’ll have two people just hitting a ball back and forth. For basketball we’ll have people fight to get a ball in one hoop. For soccer we will have two goals and two players try and score a ball in their goal however many times they can before the time is up (while facing blocks coming at them as obstacles). We can spin each game by throwing our own obstacles and twists into the regular sports.

## Profile
You will see your profile in the upper left hand corner of your screen. There you can customize your username and see all the upgrades you’ve purchased/have the ability to switch upgrades out. This will also log the amount of coins you have. 

## Point System
If you win a game, you leave the game with the amount of points or coins that you earned; the loser will not retain any coins they won. We will also have a high score system where we will have a leaderboard recording the highest scores people have earned in each game, and new players can try to beat those scores to get their username higher on the board.

## Characters/Multiplayer
Most games will only be between 2 players; some will allow solo players. You have a general skin/avatar to start with when you enter the Hub for the first time. We’ll have 3 general characters one can pick from: a male option, female option, and gender-neutral option.

## Upgrades/additions
The coins players earn in the minigames can be used to buy avatar upgrades in a shop. Things like helmets, crowns, dresses, and other accessories can be purchased to be added to one’s avatar. 

## Python Backend
The python backend will be responsible for serving frontend content to clients, as well as handling multiplayer, database, and shop logic.

## Javascript Frontend
This will be responsible for client-sided game logic, such as rendering and input handling.
Theme: neutral gray for background, black text, gold accents 
We can emphasize a dark theme to be easier on the eyes
